Exercise
The goal of the exercise is to improve the definition of a backend service/module and provide an implementation for it.
Once this is finished, you'll create a microservice that offers a REST API to consume the service/module functionality.

Note: Favour simplicity, code the solution as a single module and use packages to structure it..

1. Service Trait / Interface
Given these two synchronous and asynchronous definitions of the TokenService
